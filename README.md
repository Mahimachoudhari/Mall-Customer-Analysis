📊 Project Overview — Mall Customer Analysis

This project is a data analysis / exploratory data analysis (EDA) work aimed at studying customer behavior in a mall using a real dataset. The main goal is to understand relationships between different customer attributes and validate hypotheses using statistical testing.

It is done primarily in Python through a Jupyter Notebook (DA_project.ipynb). 


🧠 Purpose of the Project

The main intentions behind this project are:

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Explore how different customer features relate to each other
✅ Run hypothesis tests on statistical relationships
✔ Use real customer data to extract insights for business decisions 

This type of analysis is useful for understanding customer demographics, spending patterns, and data trends that could inform marketing or business strategies.


🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

The project uses the following tools and Python libraries: 

Python (programming language)

Pandas (data loading & manipulation)

Matplotlib (visualizations)

Seaborn (advanced data visualization)

SciPy (statistical analysis)


📋 Key Features & Content

📌 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project performs EDA to:

Check data quality

Explore distributions of features

Visualize relationships between variables

Gain understanding of customer demographics and behavior
(Data attributes likely include things such as Age, Income, Spending Scores — typical for Mall Customer datasets) 


📌 2. Statistical Testing

The notebook performs statistical tests like:

T-Tests

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Correlation Analysis


These tests help determine whether differences or relationships between groups (e.g., male vs female customers, age groups vs spending scores) are statistically significant. 

📌 3. Visualizations

The project likely includes visual exploration such as:

📈 Histograms
📊 Boxplots
🔗 Scatter plots
🔥 Heatmaps for correlations

These help visually inspect patterns, distributions, and relationships in the dataset. 


📄 What’s Inside the Repository

Here are the main files:

🗂 DA_project.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis code and visuals. 
📄 README.md – A short description of the project (not detailed). 


Typical Workflow in the Project

The project probably follows a workflow like:

1. Loading and inspecting the dataset

2. Cleaning data (if needed)

3. Exploratory visual analysis

4. Running statistical tests

5. Interpreting the results

6. Drawing conclusions based on tests and charts 

Business Value

This type of analysis helps answer key questions like:

✔ Which age groups spend more?
✔ Does income impact spending score?
✔ Are there meaningful correlations between customer attributes?
✔ Which customer segments should be targeted for marketing?

The results can guide data-driven decisions for improving profitability
